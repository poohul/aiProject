Protesters have been killed, buildings torched and politicians' houses looted as anti-government unrest spreads across Indonesia - and the authorities respond with force.

Mass demonstrations, fuelled by cost-of-living woes and public frustration with the political elite, first erupted in Jakarta on 25 August to condemn what many viewed as excessive pay and housing allowances for parliamentarians.

By the end of the week, things had boiled over into violence. On Thursday night, following escalating clashes between demonstrators and authorities, police in Jakarta ran over and killed 21-year-old motorcycle rideshare driver Affan Kurniawan.

President Prabowo Subianto and the chief of police apologised for his death - but it fuelled further discontent that has now spread to various corners of the archipelago, from West Java to the islands of Bali and Lombok.

At least seven people had died in the protests by Monday, according to Indonesia's co-ordinating minister for economic affairs.
